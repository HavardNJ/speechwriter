Snow White and a Dwarfs party
Snow White was invited to a Dwarfs party. When she came, she counted 43 Dwarfs. The Dwarfs
wore green, orange or red hats. The Dwarfs with green hats always told the truth. The Dwarfs with
orange hats told truth or lie every other time (for the first time they could answer either true or
false). The Dwarfs with red hats lie all the time.
In order to count the number of Dwarfs wearing different hats, Snow White asked every Dwarf three
questions (in that order):
- "Are you wearing a green hat?"
- "Are you wearing an orange hat?"
- "Are you wearing a red hat?"
Totally she got 34 positive answers to the first question, 26 positive answers to the second question
and 11 positive answers to the third question.
How many Dwarfs with orange hats attended the party?

So what we know: 
G + O + R = 43

Green question would give a positive answer for truthful green, a random amount of lying orange and for lying red
G + OQ1 + R = 34

Orange question would give a positive answer for the orange hatted that lied on last one and tell the truth now and for lying red
OQ2 + R = 26

Red question would give a positive answer for lying orange only
OQ3 = 11

It's the same orange hatted who would lie on the first, tell the truth on the second and lie on the third question
OQ1 = OQ2 = OQ3 = 11

subst in green question
G + R = 34 - 11 = 23

then
O = 43 - (G + R) = 43 - 23 = 20

so 20 orange hatted dwarfs.
